This repo is to hold all the pieces required aggregate the DynamoDB records for Alakazam, including tools to parse, decode, and sort the data from the archive file. The file should be aggregated using the datapipeline.json profile for AWS's Data Pipeline service (use the cli and the instructions [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/latest/DeveloperGuide/dp-crossregion-ddb-upload-cli.html)).
